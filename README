This is the Parse::Tokens module.

Parse::Tokens provides a simple base class for parsing text with embedded tokens.

To install the module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Changes in this version...

	0.20
	- added multi-token support

	0.17
	- delimiters() now returns an array of references to the real and the escaped
	delimiters. This differs from previous behavior where an array reference
	was returned.
