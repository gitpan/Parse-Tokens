This is the Parse::Tokens module.

Parse::Tokens provides a simple base class for parsing text with embedded tokens.

To install the module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Changes in this version...

   delimiters() now returns an array of real, escaped delimiters. This
   differs previous behavior where an array reference was returned.
